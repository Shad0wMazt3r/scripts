# Main idea
- Upload any script you have created or used, that you think might be useful for others !
- The main idea is that by the end of some time, we will have a database of useful scripts that can be used in pentesting - or any situation.
- Made a quick dirty python script to decode `brainfuck` for a CTF? Post it here! People can learn from you, and use it too!
