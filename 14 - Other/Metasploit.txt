-- Intro --

Metasploit, an open-source pentesting framework, is a powerful tool utilized by security engineers around the world. Maintained by Rapid 7, Metasploit is a collection of not only thoroughly tested exploits but also auxiliary and post-exploitation tools. It contains a large database of almost every major CVE, which you can easily use against a machine.



-- Types of Modules --

Note, This diagram does not include the 'Post' module.


𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗶𝘁 - Holds all of the exploit code

𝗣𝗮𝘆𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱 - Used hand in hand with exploits, this module contains the various bits of shellcode we send to have executed following exploitation

𝗘𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗿 - Commonly utilized in payload obfuscation, this module allows us to modify the 'appearance' of our exploit such that we may avoid signature detection

𝗡𝗢𝗣 - This module is used with buffer overflow and ROP attacks

𝗔𝘂𝘅𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿𝘆 - This module is most commonly used in scanning and verification that machines are exploitable

𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘁 - One of the most common activities after exploitation is looting and pivoting

-- Tips --

set LHOST to 𝘁𝘂𝗻𝟬 - instead of your ip adress
run post/windows/gather/checkvm - determine if you're in a VM (very useful piece of knowledge for further pivoting)
run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester - This will check for various exploits which can be run within the session to elevate privileges
run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp - force RDP to be available
